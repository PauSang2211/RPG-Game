# RPG-Game
This was a school final project for an introduction course to Python. 

# Goals:
* To utilize basic Python commands and data structures <br />
* To understand object-oriented programming with Python <br />
* To understand GUI systems in Python <br />
* To understand File I/O operations 

# Overview:
This is an RPG game where you fight monsters, level up, and obtain items from enemies. <br />
You begin by typing the name of three different files: <br />
* An item file containing all the items that exists in the game
* A player file containing all the data related to the player
* An enemy file containing all the enemies that exists in the game

Once these entries are completed and files are parsed, the game begins. You are faced with an enemy. You can choose to fight, open your inventory, or run. 
* Fight: fighting mechanism is turn-based and actions are calculated through a basic mathematical function. 
* Inventory: allows you to open your inventory to restore health or change equipment for better stats. 
* Run: allows you to run away from the monster and fight a different monster. 

After each battle, you restore your health and you get EXP and (potentially) item drops.
